We tried doing networking all we could but there were errors arising due connection being disconnected.
Initially we got working for input from two clients but after making changes to the game it was no longer 
functional and we couldn't debug it in time. The game compiles and runs normally for both single and double player modes 
both players being controlled from the keyboard.
